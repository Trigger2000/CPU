# CPU

Simple emulator of assembler machine, based on stack calculations. Has commands, described in "command.h" files, that translates into byte code ("log.txt") and then executes it. 

file "in.txt" has input program. All written commands are transfered to stack and than executed. For example, here is a solver of quadratic aquation with a = 7, b = 0, c = -6. Another example of input program locates in "print_sqr.txt" - prints squares of natural numbers from 0 to 50.
